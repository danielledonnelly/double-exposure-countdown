This is a countdown I created for the game I'm most eagerly anticipating in 2024, Life is Strange: Double Exposure.

Life is Strange was my entire life when I was a teenager; I was obsessed. Part of that was because Max Caulfield was the first video game protagonist I related to and saw myself in. She was a socially awkward, extremely self-conscious, nerdy teenage girl, just like me. 

It's been nearly a decade since I first became obsessed with Max's journey, and now I'm beyond excited for her return to the series as an adult.

If you're excited too, check out the countdown [here](https://danielledonnelly.github.io/double-exposure-countdown/).
