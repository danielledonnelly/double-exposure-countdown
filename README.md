This is a countdown I created for the game I'm most eagerly anticipating in 2024, Life is Strange: Double Exposure.

Life is Strange was my entire life when I was a teenager; I was obsessed. It was a game that made me realize a lot of things about myself.
Max Caulfield was the first video game protagonist I related to and saw myself in. She was socially awkward, extremely self-conscious, introverted, and nerdy. 

It feels so strange but exciting to be returning to the series now as an adult, almost an entire decade after I became obsessed with the original.
